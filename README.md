# Latest-Laptop-Deals-API

This is an API I made out of curiosity, as I love (gaming) laptops and even browsing for them makes me happy. I deployed the program using Heroku and then publicly hosted at RapidAPI.com.

This API will extract laptop deals currently available around the internet (via Reddit). It scrapes the html links and extracts the links using Cheerio.js.
